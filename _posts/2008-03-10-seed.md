Seed is a multiplatform C++ game development framework that aims mainly at recompile only portability between a wide range of platforms and consoles.

We have support for Windows, Linux, MacOSX, iOS (any device) and Nintendo Wii. In the long run I plan to get it running in the Android and Google Native Client (NaCl), also as an experiment I will port it to the PS3 with the open source ps3sdk and for psp with the open source pspsdk.

The project website is in (continuous) development, you can access it here: <a href='http://www.seedframework.org' target='_new'>Seed Framework</a>.

Any questions, don't think twice before contacting me.
