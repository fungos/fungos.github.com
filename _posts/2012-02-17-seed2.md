Yes, as you can see by the post title, we're working in a new version of Seed Framework, just Seed 2.
Why create another version? Well, we will loose the rules a little, letting seed grow in the direction of user responsibility and a lot less babysitting.
Loosing things means that the code be a lot more flexible about memory, files, structures, etc.
The changes includes:
- Removal of all memory management, pooling and memory restrictions.
- Removal of precompiled assets, exporters and compilers.
- Rewrite of filesystem and file to use <a href='http://icculus.org/physfs/'>physfs</a>.
- Rewrite of parts of multi platform support, removing platforms like Nintendo Wii.
- Rewrite of sprite, optimizing and making it even more flexible.
- Make use of <a href='http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/'>JSON</a> as data format instead of xml+compilation.
- Removal of all GUI related code, including Text and Font.
- Adding TTF support.
- Adding a third party GUI library, most probably <a href='http://librocket.com/'>libRocket</a>.
- Adding <a href='http://www.lua.org/'>Lua</a> scripting.
- Adding support to other windowing library, <a href='http://www.glfw.org/'>glfw</a> instead of SDL.
- An editor, finally - in Qt!

But the most important change of all, is the licensing terms and conditions, being very liberal license, BSD-modified.
Also note that we still use SDL 1.2 and its licensing terms must be respected. To solve this problem, we will support <a href='http://www.glfw.org/'>glfw</a> that is <a href='http://www.glfw.org/license.html'>zlib/libpng</a> based.

With all these changes, we hope that Seed will be more accessible and easier for everyone. Enabling fast prototyping and development of indie games for all supported platforms (win, osx, linux and ios).

Also we will have help of more developers, <a href='http://nullonerror.appspot.com/'>Rodrigo 'Skhaz' Delduca</a>, Thiago C. Moraes and others.
